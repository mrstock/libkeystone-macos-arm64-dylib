# Keystone Engine compiled library version 0.9.2

compiled library for macos apple silicon processor ( **ARM64 / AArch64** )

e.g. needed for IDA PRO keypatch python plugin

### WHY ?

because the library is missing from Homebrew Formulae "keystone" and maybe you don't want to waste your time to build it
